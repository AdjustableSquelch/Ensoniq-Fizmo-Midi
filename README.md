Ensoniq-Fizmo-Midi
==================

Tools and information for the MIDI spec of the Ensoniq Fizmo Synthesizer.

Live version of documentation: http://adjustablesquelch.github.io/Ensoniq-Fizmo-Midi/

The Fizmo is a great synth but due to various issues it was rushed out without its complete midi spec being documented. This repository is to contain tools to work with the Fiz and the spec as we discover it.

Get in contact if you have some things to share.
